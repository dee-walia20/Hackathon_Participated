    "NLP is a branch of data science that consists of systematic processes for analyzing, understanding, and deriving information from the text data in a smart and efficient manner. By utilizing NLP and its components, one can organize the massive chunks of text data, perform numerous automated tasks and solve a wide range of problems such as – automatic summarization, machine translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation etc.\n",

    "For example – language stopwords (commonly used words of a language – is, am, the, of, in etc), URLs or links, social media entities (mentions, hashtags), punctuations and industry specific words. This step deals with removal of all types of noisy entities present in the text. A general approach for noise removal is to prepare a dictionary of noisy entities, and iterate the text object by tokens (or by words), eliminating those tokens which are present in the noise dictionary."

    "\n",
    "There are many approaches for obtaining topics from a text such as – Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency. NonNegative Matrix Factorization techniques. Latent Dirichlet Allocation is the most popular topic modeling technique and in this article, we will discuss the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA assumes documents are produced from a mixture of topics. Those topics then generate words based on their probability distribution. Given a dataset of documents, LDA backtracks and tries to figure out what topics would create those documents in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is a matrix factorization technique. In vector space, any corpus (collection of documents) can be represented as a document-term matrix. The following matrix shows a corpus of N documents D1, D2, D3 … Dn and vocabulary size of M words W1,W2 .. Wn. The value of i,j cell gives the frequency count of word Wj in Document Di.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Modeling2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA converts this Document-Term Matrix into two lower dimensional matrices – M1 and M2.\n",
    "M1 is a document-topics matrix and M2 is a topic – terms matrix with dimensions (N,  K) and (K, M) respectively, where N is the number of documents, K is the number of topics and M is the vocabulary size.\n",

    "otice that these two matrices already provides topic word and document topic distributions, However, these distribution needs to be improved, which is the main aim of LDA. LDA makes use of sampling techniques in order to improve these matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "It Iterates through each word “w” for each document “d” and tries to adjust the current topic – word assignment with a new assignment. A new topic “k” is assigned to word “w” with a probability P which is a product of two probabilities p1 and p2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every topic, two probabilities p1 and p2 are calculated. P1 – p(topic t / document d) = the proportion of words in document d that are currently assigned to topic t. P2 – p(word w / topic t) = the proportion of assignments to topic t over all documents that come from this word w.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current topic – word assignment is updated with a new topic with the probability, product of p1 and p2 . In this step, the model assumes that all the existing word – topic assignments except the current word are correct. This is essentially the probability that topic t generated word w, so it makes sense to adjust the current word’s topic with new probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a number of iterations, a steady state is achieved where the document topic and topic term distributions are fairly good. This is the convergence point of LDA."

    "### Text Classification\n",
    "Text classification is one of the classical problem of NLP. Notorious examples include – Email Spam Identification, topic classification of news, sentiment classification and organization of web pages by search engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification, in common words is defined as a technique to systematically classify a text object (document or sentence) in one of the fixed category. It is really helpful when the amount of data is too large, especially for organizing, information filtering, and storage purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical natural language classifier consists of two parts: (a) Training (b) Prediction as shown in image below. Firstly the text input is processes and features are created. The machine learning models then learn these features and is used for predicting against the new text.\n",
